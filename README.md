# sql-employees
**Directive:**

This project uses mock data to conduct a research project about people employed with a company during the 1980s and 1990s from 6 CSV files (located in the data folder). To use this code, run the sql_chall_schema.sql in pgAdmin, import the CSV files, then run challenge_queries.sql for the data analysis. 

**Data Modeling: Create ERD** 

*ERD can also be found in ERD_image folder; ERD was created using QuickDBD*
